# ðŸ“š Library Management System â€“ Assignment 6

This Java-based project implements a Library Management System that allows librarians to manage book records and students to borrow/return books. It uses object-oriented principles and file handling to store data persistently.

## Project Structure

```
Library management system

â”œâ”€â”€ Main.java                  # Entry point of the program
â”œâ”€â”€ books.txt                 # Stores list of available books
â”œâ”€â”€ students.txt              # Stores student data
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ library/                  # Contains supporting classes
    â”œâ”€â”€ Book.java             # Book object structure
    â”œâ”€â”€ BookFileHandler.java # Book file read/write handler
    â”œâ”€â”€ bookNotFound.java     # Custom exception for book not found
    â”œâ”€â”€ Librarian.java        # Handles librarian actions
    â”œâ”€â”€ Student.java          # Handles student actions
    â”œâ”€â”€ LibrarySystem.java    # Central system logic and state
    â”œâ”€â”€ invalidUser.java      # Custom exception for invalid users
```

##  How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites

* Java 8 or above

### Steps

1. **Compile the code:**

   ```bash
   javac Main.java library/*.java
   ```

2. **Run the program:**

   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

> Ensure `books.txt` and `students.txt` are in the same directory as `Main.java`.

##  Functionalities

###  Librarian Menu

After logging in with valid credentials (`ID: 123`, `Name: librarian`), the librarian can:

* Add new books
* Delete existing books
* View all books
* Search books by title or author

###  Student Menu

Upon entering a valid 4-digit ID, a student can:

* Search for books
* Borrow available books
* Return borrowed books
* View their list of borrowed books

> Student input is validated. Invalid IDs (non-4-digit) will raise an error.
